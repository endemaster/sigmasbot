          <h1>Overview / Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                You've probably landed here because you are interested in how this telegram bot works.
              <strong>Well, I'm begging you, even though the GitHub repo is public, don't peek in the source code, please.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways, I made this in like 50 hours and just slapped everything together, so it's kinda messy, but idk how it manages to work (some of the time)
            </p>
            <p>
               By now, you've probably tried out the bot yourself (if you didn't get slapped with a whitelist error thingy) 
            </p>
          <p>The reason why most of the features in this bot operates on a whitelist is to prevent spamming expensive things like /gpt and stuff that actually cost money yk.</p>
